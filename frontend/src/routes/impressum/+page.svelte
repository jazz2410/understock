    <h1 class="mb-3 text-2xl font-bold">Disclaimer - legal notice</h1>
    <h1 class="mb-3 text-xl font-bold">ยง 1 Content warning</h1>
    <p class="mb-3">The free and freely accessible content of this website has been created with the greatest possible 
        care, but the provider of this website does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the free 
        and freely accessible journalistic advice and news. Contributions identified by name reflect the 
        opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. Simply by calling up 
        the free and freely accessible content, no contractual 
        relationship is established between the user and the provider; in this respect, there is no intention 
        on the part of the provider to be legally bound.</p>

        <h1 class="mb-3 text-xl font-bold">ยง 2 External Links</h1>
        <p class="mb-3">This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These 
            websites are subject to the liability of the respective operators. When the external links 
            were first created, the provider checked the external content for any legal violations. At 
            that time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current 
            and future design and content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not 
            imply that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as its own. A 
            constant control of the external links is not reasonable for the provider without concrete 
            evidence of violations. However, in the event of knowledge of legal violations, such 
            external links will be deleted immediately.</p>

            <h1 class="mb-3 text-xl font-bold">ยง 3 Copyrights and ancillary copyrights</h1>

                    website deviate from the aforementioned paragraphs, this will be expressly 
                    pointed out at the appropriate place. In this case, the special conditions of use
